# Ranking List

Build custom lists of entry/score pairs.

Pretty much just a UI wrapper of a Python dictionary, with
an added descending sort feature.

## How to use
Enter a title and a score in the top entry fields and click the
add/remove buttons to start building a list.

View currently loaded list items in the center display area.

Save, load, and delete save files with the bottom entry 
field and buttons.
